# dupefinder
Python code to manage duplicate files with sqlite

Usage:

1) search duplicate files with either utility (dedupe.py or dedupeo.py)

2) use a generic sqlite-GUI for marking the "master copies" and / or "deletable" items

3) write a program to erase the deletables or "other copies than master copies", or wait for a script to appear here to help with the cleanup

4) enjoy your increased storage space

Command line parameter may be given or omitted. If given, it means the root directory of the search.

Thanks to Edvard Majakari for help with the class oriented implementation.
